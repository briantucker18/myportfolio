        <h3>Experience</h3>
        <p>I have over 7 years of classroom teaching experience where I have taught students from as young as 2 years old to those in their 70s. While the majority of my teaching experience has been in the teaching of English language and literature courses, I have also cotaught a social studies course and have several years of experience working in special education using pull-out and push-in model teaching as well. I have worked with students with various forms of autism, ADHD, as well as various other sensory and processing challenges. As a teacher with ADHD myself, I know exactly how mental differences can often be a gift, which when harnessed properly can allow for greater learning than traditional students in certain areas.  </p>

    <h3>Approaches to Teaching</h3>
    <p>As a teacher, I am most influenced by approaches to teaching and learning that are student centered, multisensory, and competency based. Rather than focusing on honing my skills as a lecturer, I focus instead on the skills each individual student needs and help them build those skills through mindfully crafted authentic activities. Just as it is wiser to teach a man to fish rather than give him a fish, I think that students should be taught skills rather than being fed lectures. This not only creates a more active and enjoyable class, but allows for students to use their new skills to learn using content that is interesting to them and useful in their particular context. When working with students with learning differences, rather than using Differentiation to give students different challenges when lesson planning that suit their strengths, I think that in the long term it is better to use Universal Design when lesson planning to create lessons where students with any skill set can achieve the goals from various approaches and use Differentiation only during actual teaching.</p>
